# EQ2CollQuests
This program began as a more elegant solution to a problem EverQuest 2 players have had for a very long time; how to track their collection quests across multiple characters.
The existing solution was to have pages of spreadsheets with complex logic that tracked an item across multiple quests and player characters. As the design for this program
matured, it became smart enough to employ Daybreak Games' RESTful Census site. This would allow the program to automagically import all of a player's characters, their
current collection quests statuses, and give insight into which collection items were still required.

This program was primarily written in C# using .NET Framework 4.7.2.

This program was last developed in 2020. The Census API has changed since then and the program no longer functions as intended, but the Census service developer ID has been
reactivated as of 2026-01-29 for testing. I hope you enjoy perusing this repository.
