<h1>The Character Page</h1>
<p>The Character Page is broken up into three main parts: The Character List, The Character's Quest List, The Character's Quest's Items.</p>
<h2>The Character List</h2>
<p>This area lists your characters in alphabetical order. The buttons at the bottom of the list allow you to add additional characters, update the information
about a character from Daybreak Games's Census Server, and delete a character.</p>
<p>To add a character, click on the <q>add</q> button and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>To update a character, highlight the character you wish to have updated and click the <q>update</q> button.</p>
<p>To delete a character, highlight the character you wish to delete, click the <q>delete</q> button and confirm your choice.</p>
<p>Once you have selected a character, that character's name, level and adventuring class will display above the list of collection quests that character is
already on.</p>
<h2>The Character's Quest List</h2>
<p>Clicking on one of the character's quests will show a list of items related to that quest. If the selected character has already collected an item, the
check box beside that item will be checked.</p>
<p>At this time, the check boxes cannot be modified. This will change in a future version.</p>
