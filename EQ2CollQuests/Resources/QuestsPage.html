<h1>Quests</h1>
<p>The quests page is divied up into three sections. On the left-hand column is a list of all the quests currently downloaded to your machine. The right-hand
side is split between the information pane at the top and a tree of items underneath.</p>
<h2>Quest List</h2>
<p>The list of quests is sorted alphabetically and consists of the collection quests currently downloaded to your machine. At the bottom of this list are two
buttons labeled <b>Add</b> and <b>Update</b>.</p>
<p>The Add button allows quests to be added to the above list via the collection quest's name or unique Daybreak ID number.</p>
<p>The Update button ensures that all items for all quests are currently downloaded. In the event that there are missing items, this button will resolve this.
Selecting an individual quest will also check for the presence of all items in that quest and download any missing items.</p>
<h2>Information Pane</h2>
<p>The information pane has the name of the collection quest at the very top, along with the quest's level, which indicates the general tier in which the
collectables may be found, and will indicate whether the quest is an <q>expert</q> quest.</p>
<p><b>Expert quests</b> require rare collectables, often from multiple zones and result in special rewards that frequently allow for the acquisiton of previously
hidden collection quests. Because the determination of expert quests is not always an exact science, there is a check box, allowing the user to change the
designation of a quest to or from a collection quest.</p>
<p>Quest items may be picked up at any time, but some quests will not allow a character to begin the collection quest until the character has met a
pre-determined adventure level. Because of this, the information pane includes a pair of radio buttons that allow the user to indicate whether a quest has such
a level requirement or not. The text box below the radio buttons becomes active when a required level is indicated. If the required adventure level is zero, the
radio button for <q>No required adventure level</q> is re-selected and the text box is blanked out.</p>
<p>Once a quest is selected on the left, links for the selected quest will become active in this pane. These quests lead to pages on
<a href="https://eq2.fandom.com/">EQ2i</a> (which is hosted by Fandom) and <a href="https://u.eq2wire.com/">EQ2U</a> (which is hosted by EQ2 Wire). Neither of
these pages are associated with the author of this program and are provided solely for the convenience of the user. These links will remain in this program for
this stated reason unless and until the author is asked to remove them by one or both parties.</p>
<p>Each quest has a unique Daybreak ID number, which is also listed in the upper-right corner of the information pane. This number may be selected and copied,
but not altered or removed.</p>
<h2>Item Tree</h2>
<p>The item tree consists of the items required for the selected quest. Each item may be expanded to view their presence in all downloaded characters'
collection quests. The presence or absence of an item may not be altered from the Quests Page.</p>
