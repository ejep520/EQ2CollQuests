<h1>Items Page</h1>
<p>The items page is split between two general areas, the list of items and the information available for a selected item.</p>
<h2>Item List</h2>
<p>This list contains the items currently downloaded to your machine. In testing, this list exceeded 5,000 items. In production, it is believed this list could
more than double that in size.</p>
<p>Items appended with an asterisk (*) have information about their potential (or specific) drop location. The presence of an asterisk does not differentiate
between items which drop in a zone as chest loot or those items with specific drop locations within a zone. The absence of an asterisk indicates that no such
information has been entered at this time.</p>
<p>Unlike in other pages, the items list does not have an <b>add</b> or <b>update</b> button. Items are added when new quests are encountered. To date, the
information tracked by this program is largely, if not completely, unchanged by Daybreak after a collection quest has been introduced, so no mechanism for
re-scanning the Daybreak Census server exists to confirm the details of individual or all items at this time.</p>
<h2>The Information Pane</h2>
<p>The top of the information pane shows the name of the item selected in a larger, easier-to-read font. The item's level and Daybreak ID number are available
for copying, but may not be altered or removed. Similarly, the presence or absence of a LORE or NO-TRADE flag may not be altered and are shown here for your
edification.</p>
<p>Links to these items on the <a href="https://eq2.fandom.com">EQ2i</a> and <a href="https://u.eq2wire.com/">EQ2U</a> websites are provided when you click on
an item. For more information about the lack of association between the author of this program and the providers of these websites, please refer to the <a
href="QuestsPage.html" lang="en-US">Quests Page</a> help page.</p>
<p>Three radio buttons exist to allow you to specify (with appropriate degrees of specificity) the location of an item. If an item has a fixed location,
this location may be recorded to the item by selecting the <b>Fixed Location</b> button and entering in the name of the zone and the X, Y, and Z coordinates
of the item. Once this information is saved to an item, the <b>Copy Waypoint</b> link will become active. Clicking this link will copy the waypoint given to
the clipboard along with the <code>/waypoint</code> snippet necessary for pasting directly into EQ2.</p>
<p>More is planned for the Items Page. Please watch this space for updates.</p>
